Architectural Design:
1. Components:
Controller Layer:
PublicationController: Handles HTTP requests and interacts with the Service Layer.

Service Layer:
PublicationService: It provides interaction between the caching and API services. (It contains the search(business) logic)

Service Interfaces:
CacheStoreInterface: Defines the contract for caching services.
APISourceInterface: Defines the contract for API services.

Service Implementations:
CacheService: Implements the caching service.
CrossRefAPIService: Implements the CrossRef API service.

Service Provider:
AppServiceProvider: Binds interfaces to concrete implementations in the Laravel service container.

2. Interactions:
The PublicationController receives HTTP requests and delegates the business logic to the PublicationService.

The PublicationService uses dependency injection to interact with the CacheService and CrossRefAPIService. It checks the cache first and, if needed, fetches data from the CrossRef API, updating the cache.

CacheService handles the storage and retrieval of publication data in/from the cache.

CrossRefAPIService is responsible for making requests to the CrossRef API and fetching publication data.

3. Flow:
HTTP request is received by PublicationController.
PublicationController delegates the request to PublicationService.
PublicationService checks the cache using CacheService.
If data is in the cache, return it; otherwise, fetch data from CrossRef API using CrossRefAPIService.
Update the cache with the fetched data.
Return the publication data to the client.

Considerations:

Dependency Injection:
Dependency injection is used to provide flexibility and ease of testing.

Interfaces:
Interfaces define contracts for services, allowing for easy substitution.

Service Provider:
Laravel's service provider binds interfaces to concrete implementations.

Caching:
The caching mechanism is abstracted into a separate service (CacheService), enabling easy changes to the caching strategy.
External API Interaction:

Interaction with the CrossRef API is encapsulated in CrossRefAPIService, promoting separation of concerns.
